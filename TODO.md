# TODO

- Make interface responsive: column on the phone, wider video and horizontal on laptop
- Make those overlay elements customizable (add some knobs to toolbar)
- Style the marquee to be more presentable
- Add jss to keep styles programmable
- Find a way to listen to timeline events of the playing video

## Wishes

Make it connect between the host and the viewers. Host can broadcast new marquee messages real-time.
Viewers can request other videos (vote for them?) and once those are promoted they will be played instead.
